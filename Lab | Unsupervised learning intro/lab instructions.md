# Lab | Unsupervised learning intro

#### Description

We had to create a song recommendation application. Users are asked to enter a song title and the recommender will suggest a song that is similar. 

To do this, I used an unsupervised learning technique called k-means to cluster songs by their audio features. Audio features were added to each song title using the Spotify database and accessed via the Spotify API.


#### Clusters
In order to find the best clusters, we had to test different ways of grouping and analyse the features of each cluster.
