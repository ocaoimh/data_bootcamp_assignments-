In the Honolulu Heart Study, a sample of `n = 100` people had an average systolic blood pressure of 130.1 mm Hg with a standard deviation of 21.21 mm Hg. Is the group significantly different (with respect to systolic blood pressure!) from the regular population?\n",

    "We'll have a two tailed test as our instructions for the creating Ha (below) does not ask to to estimate if the mean systolic blood pressure is higher or lower (two directions) but if the sample is not equal to the mean - therefore it's in one direction. \n",
